# A Quasar Project
This project is a Vue.js-based clone of the Kahve Dünyası website, created to practice component-based architecture and modern frontend development techniques. It features five main components: Home, Menu, Cart, Coffee–Chocolate–Accessory, and Corporate Gifts, each designed to replicate the structure and functionality of the original site. The project showcases the use of Vue Router for navigation, reusable components, and a clean, responsive layout inspired by the real Kahve Dünyası website.
Additionally, Firebase has been integrated to handle user authentication, enabling registration and login functionality. This demonstrates practical use of backend services in a frontend-focused project and enhances the interactive features of the site.
