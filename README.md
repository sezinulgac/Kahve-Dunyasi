# A Quasar Project
This project is a Vue.js-based clone of the Kahve Dünyası website, developed to practice component-based architecture and modern frontend techniques. It consists of five main components: Home, Menu, Cart, Coffee–Chocolate–Accessory, and Corporate Gifts, each designed to reflect the structure and functionality of the original site. The project demonstrates the use of Vue Router for navigation, reusable components, and a clean layout inspired by the real Kahve Dünyası website.

## Install the dependencies

yarn
# or
